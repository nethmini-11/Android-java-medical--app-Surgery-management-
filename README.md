## Individual Fuunction Surgery Management:

The patient must first enter their relevant information and submit the form. It is also possible to upload a document.  The entered information is then stored in a separate sqlite database containing the surgical details.  The user has the ability to edit and delete the entered information and it is displayed as a separate list.  In addition, there is a possibility to delete applications at once.  In addition, there is a separate page to access information on surgery fees.  In this case, if the person has insurance money, the sum will be deducted from the sum of the doctor charge,selected package fee and hospital charges, and if other special facilities are required, the relevant charges will be added separately and the total amount will be displayed.
